BMI Calculation App
The BMI Calculation App is a user-friendly tool designed to help individuals quickly and easily calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI), providing valuable insights into their health and fitness levels. Here’s how the app works:

User Input:

Height: The user enters their height in centimeters or inches.

Weight: The user enters their weight in kilograms or pounds.

BMI Calculation:

The app uses the standard BMI formula: $$ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2} $$ 

Results Display:

Once the calculation is complete, the app displays the user’s BMI value.


Underweight: BMI < 18.5

Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9

Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9

Obesity: BMI ≥ 30
